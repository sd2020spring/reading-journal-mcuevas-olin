I realized that I was accidentally using Matlab syntax instead of Python syntax. So I then went through the code, ensuring that I was using the correct language. I then ensured that it wouldnt cause any other issues down the line. Some things I could do to prevent bugs such as this one is to go over the appropriate syntax beforehand, maybe have a little cheat sheet to ensure that I do not mix coding languages up again."

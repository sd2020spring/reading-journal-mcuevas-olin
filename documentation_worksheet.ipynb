    "When naming a class, function, or variable, it's helpful to start with a couple assumptions about the reader:\n",
    "\n",
    "* They have an idea of what the overall project is supposed to do.\n",
    "* They know at least as good of a programmer as you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that you shouldn't be too redundant in your names. Calling a generic Student class something like `StudentBaseClass` communicates too much - the reader will be able to figure that out by looking at the class implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use consistent capitalization rules when naming things. In Python, classes should be named with camel case (e.g., `StudentBaseClass`), while functions and variables should be named with snake case (e.g., `student_roster`). If you create a constant, that is, a variable that shouldn't ever be changed, keep snake case but make it all caps (e.g., `BITS_IN_BYTE`).\n",
    "\n",
    "When naming functions, you should be careful to avoid duplicating names, or creating names that are similar to others. For example, if you define a function called `get_input` twice, the second definition will overwrite the first. If you write two functions called `process` and `process2`, it's also not clear how the two functions differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also helpful to be concise yet clear when naming functions. In the second example above, a function named `process` should be renamed because it isn't clear what is being processed. A name like `process_raw_data` might be more helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "When naming variables, it's especially helpful to be clear about what the variable *represents* rather than what it *is*. So rather than calling a variable `input_list`, it makes more sense to call it something like `daily_stock_prices`. Generally, names like `count`, `num`, `index`, or `average` are not very descriptive, and should probably be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being precise is also important, though the right level of precision depends on the context. For example, if you are writing code to simulate the orbit of the earth around the sun, then a numerical variable called `radius`, while describing what the number represents, isn't precise enough - it could be the radius of the sun, the radius of the earth, or the radius of the orbit itself. A name like `earth_to_sun` is probably more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are times when you might not use the value of a variable. For example, you may have to do something for every element in a list, but not actually need the element itself. In this case, you can use the underscore (`_`) as a variable to indicate that the value is not used. (It's actually a valid variable name, and you can use it like a normal variable, but we recommend that you don't.)"

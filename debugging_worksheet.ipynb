    "In programming languages, *syntax* refers to the set of rules about what constitutes a valid statement. As an example from linguistics, a valid (syntactically correct) English sentence needs to start with a capitalized word, end in a period, question mark, or exclamation point, etc. Note that syntax has nothing to do with the correctness of the code itself, or whether the code will even run successfully. [\"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_green_ideas_sleep_furiously) is a valid sentence using the rules of English syntax but doesn't have a widely agreed-upon meaning, and the statement `x += 42` on its own is a valid Python expression but won't execute successfully because `x` does not have a value.\n",

    "The location of the error consists of a file, line number, and position in that line. In the message above, notice that the file is `\"<ipython-input-...>\"` (which is the format for cells in a Jupyter noteook). In a `.py` file, this would be the name of the file itself. The line number tells you where in the file the error occurred, and the caret (`^`) shows you where in the line the error occurred. It's worth noting that the caret will point to the spot where Python *first detects that there must be a syntax error*, not necessarily to the location that needs to be fixed. Take a look at this example:"

    "The error message can sometimes give you a helpful clue as to what has gone wrong. In the first example above, you should have gotten the error message \"unexpected EOF while parsing\" (EOF stands for *end of file*). This message tells you that as the Python interpreter was scanning to find the end of the tuple, it hit the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, sometimes the error message is less helpful: in the second example above, you should have only gotten the message \"invalid syntax\", which provides almost no additional information. As a helpful tip, the message \"invalid syntax\" almost always means that you forgot to close a paired delimiter (i.e., you left out a `)`, `]`, or `}`) or that you left out a colon (`:`) at the end of a statement starting with `if`, `for`, `while`, `with`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that in addition to `SyntaxError`, there is another type of syntax error you may encounter: `IndentationError`. You have probably noticed that when you start an `if` or similar statement, end it with a colon, and press Enter, the next line will be indented by 4 spaces. (The actual number of spaces does not matter, as long as you are consistent.) An `IndentationError` indicates that this rule has been violated in some way."

    "\n",
    "Exceptions in Python can happen for a large possible number of reasons. When you encounter an exception, the most helpful step is usually to read the error message to understand exactly what happened. That being said, the most common errors are usually `NameError` (the variable or function that you are trying to use has not been defined yet), `AttributeError` (similar to `NameError` but for members of a class), or `TypeError` (you mistakenly tried to do something like add an `int` and a `list`).\n",

Accidentally inverting your function arguments (for example, calling `foo(\"bar\", 42)` instead of `foo(42, \"bar\")` can cause a variety of exceptions. The [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module in Python can be very helpful for checking types.\n",
    "* Make sure you have updated your code correctly. For example, if at various points you strip out the first 4 characters of a string like `foo[4:]` and use this in multiple places, make sure that whenever you change this in one place, you change it in others as well. Better yet, define a function or variable for things like this so that you only have to change it in one place."
